Happy Dasara shubhaakaankshalu

It is also called Vijayadhashami

Dasara or Vijayadhashami is a 9 day festival. Last three days are Durgashtami, MahaNavami and Vijayadhashami respectively. People used to celebrate this festival all 9 days in olden days, three days in the last decade, now it is reduced to one day recently like many Hindu festivals in India, because of the introduction of 'Government, Public & Bank Holidays in India' and continuous ignorance of Hindus towards their culture.
